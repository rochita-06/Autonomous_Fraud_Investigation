# 🛡️ Autonomous Fraud Investigation System

An AI-powered system that not only detects fraud but **investigates relationships between entities using Graph Intelligence, AI Agents, and RAG-based reasoning**.

> ⚡ Unlike traditional fraud detection systems that only score transactions, this system **analyzes networks, explains decisions, and simulates real-world fintech investigation workflows**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 **AI-Based Fraud Detection**
  - Risk scoring using intelligent rules + ML-style logic
- 🌐 **Graph Intelligence (Neo4j)**
  - Detects hidden relationships between users, devices, and transactions
- 🔍 **Relationship-Based Fraud Analysis**
  - Identifies fraud rings, shared devices, suspicious clusters
- 📊 **Interactive Dashboard**
  - Real-time visualization of fraud insights
- 🤖 **AI Investigation Agent**
  - Explains *why* a transaction is fraudulent
- 📚 **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
  - Uses past fraud cases to improve reasoning
- 🔗 **Automation Ready (n8n)**
  - Extendable to real-world alerting workflows

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Traditional fraud detection systems:
- Work on **isolated transactions**
- Generate **high false positives**
- Lack **explainability**

Modern systems are shifting toward:
- Graph-based fraud detection
- AI-driven investigation pipelines
- Explainable decision systems :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

👉 This project simulates that **next-generation fraud investigation system**.

## 🏗️ System Architecture
```bash
Frontend (Next.js Dashboard)
↓
Backend (FastAPI)
↓
PostgreSQL (Transactions DB)
↓
Neo4j (Graph Intelligence)
↓
RAG + AI Agents
↓
(Optional) n8n Automation
```

---

## 📊 Workflow

1. User submits transaction / user_id
2. Backend calculates fraud risk score
3. Graph DB analyzes relationships
4. RAG retrieves similar fraud cases
5. AI Agent generates explanation
6. Frontend displays:
   - Risk Score
   - Graph Intelligence
   - Investigation Report

### 📈 Impact

1.Detects fraud beyond rule-based systems

2.Uses graph relationships instead of isolated data

3.Reduces false positives using network intelligence

4.Simulates real fintech fraud investigation pipelines

5.Modern fraud systems increasingly rely on:

6.Graph analysis

7.AI reasoning

8.Real-time pipelines

### 🔥 Key Highlight

💡 “This system doesn’t just detect fraud — it investigates it.”

### 🧪 Example Use Case

1. User A makes transaction

2. System detects:

3. Same device used by 3 accounts

4. Suspicious transfer pattern

5. Graph reveals fraud ring

6. AI explains:

👉 “Linked to known fraudulent cluster”

### 🧩 Future Improvements

1. Real-time streaming (Kafka)

2. Advanced ML models (XGBoost / DL)

3. Cloud deployment (AWS/GCP)

4. Real payment gateway integration

5. Production-grade monitoring
